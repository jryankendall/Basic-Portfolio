## About
- Basic-Portfolio is an example website built from scratch in HTML and CSS, using a picture reference for a guide. It isn't particularly functional and serves more as a demonstration of the language. It was built for the Vanderbilt Bootcamp homework assignment 1, due January 28, 2019. Images are placeholders.

## License
- No idea.

## How to use this code
- Being CSS and HTML, if you want to edit or use this, you shouldn't need any special extra instructions.

## Contribution Guidelines
  This was built for a homework assignment and as such will likely not be edited later, but comments, critique, and suggestions are always welcome, for use in future work!
